# Diabetes-Prediction
As part of my 'Supervised Learning' class, I worked on analyzing the diabetes dataset to help determine whether an individual has diabetes or not.

### Data Analysis

In the initial phase, an exploration of the diabetes dataset was conducted, analyzing feature distributions and interrelationships among them.

### Data Preprocessing

Several steps were taken in data preprocessing, including feature selection to discard redundant attributes, handling missing values, and subsequent outlier removal to enhance data quality.

### Modeling

Multiple classification models were implemented and evaluated for their predictive performance:

- **Logistic Regression**
- **K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)**
- **Support Vector Machine (SVM)**
- **Decision Tree**
- **Voting Classifier**
- **Random Forest**


### Results
While all models showed promise with the potential to achieve an accuracy of around 70%, the best performing model was the Random Forest model, with an accuracy of 78%.

### Conclusion

The comprehensive evaluation highlighted the superiority of the Random Forest model in predicting diabetes cases within the dataset. Its ability to achieve higher accuracy compared to other models suggests its suitability for this particular classification task.
